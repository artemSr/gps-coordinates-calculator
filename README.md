# gps-coordinates-calculator
In the project directory, you can run:

"npm run dev"
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The application takes the latitude and longitude values of two points into inputs and gives the result as the distance between the points in kilometers and, using Google maps, shows the points with markers and draws a line between them. Inputs accept coordinates as a floating point number, for example: latitude = 46.4775, longitude = 30.7326 (coordinates of the city of Odessa).
